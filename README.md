## Game Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Two players take turns to place their marks (X or O) in an empty square.
3. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
4. The game ends in a draw if all squares are filled and no player has three in a row.
